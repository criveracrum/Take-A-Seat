# Take-A-Seat
The ultimate solution for open seating workspaces

Project Scope Area: 
This project aims to offer a solution to open office “hot desking” called Take-A-Seat.  Users will be able to either offer their desk/workspace up on days they might not be in the office OR reserve available desks, workspaces, private rooms, etc. Users will be provided with a feed of available offerings so that they can quickly choose a space that will work for them. Users can also plan with their selected teams on workspaces that might work best for upcoming meetings.
